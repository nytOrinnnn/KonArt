            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>Hellow and Welcome!... My name is Laurence, a Senior High School Student at STI Collage Tagaytay. I currently studying <span>Mobile App and Web programming </span> under the MAWD strand at my school. <br><br>
            My dream is to become a <span>full stack developer.</span> I'm not really sure what kind of developer I want to become because there are so many options to choose from. That's why I will try every fields of programming, <span>I will study everything.</span> Thats my GOAL for now. <br><br>
            For my <span>HOBBIES</span>, I enjoy drawing, watching anime, playing online games, and I also play badminton as my sport. I love quiet and relaxing places, I'm not actually an introvet but I like to be alone. Working alone gives me more freedom, but collabing with others is fun so I prefer to choose either of those two.  </p>
