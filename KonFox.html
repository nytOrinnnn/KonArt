            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>Hellow and Welcome!... My name is Laurence, a Senior High School Student at STI Collage Tagaytay. I currently studying <span>Mobile App and Web programming </span> under the MAWD strand at my school. <br><br>
            My dream is to become a <span>full stack developer.</span> I'm not really sure what kind of developer I want to become because there are so many options to choose from. That's why I will try every fields of programming, <span>I will study everything.</span> Thats my GOAL for now. <br><br>
            For my <span>HOBBIES</span>, I enjoy drawing, watching anime, playing online games, and I also play badminton as my sport. I love quiet and relaxing places, I'm not actually an introvet but I like to be alone. Working alone gives me more freedom, but collabing with others is fun so I prefer to choose either of those two.  </p>

                        <h1>PROGRAMMING</h1>
                        <p>Throughout my journey in learning programming, I've learned different types of programming. Thanks to my teachers, I was able to learned Java programming language and mobile app development using android studio. I also learned web development by self exploring and by the knowledge that I got in school. Lastly, I was able to hone my skills in designing and I can now apply these skills on CSS and HTML. <br><br>
                        <span>By the help of my teachers at STI, I was able to learned Java, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Mobile App Development, Designing, and simple Database using SQLite.</span> </p>

                    <div id="plat">
                        <h1>PLATFORMS</h1>
                        <p><span>These are the platforms that I frequently use when programming and designing.</span></p>

                                <h4>DESIGNING</h4>
                                <p>When it commes to designing, I can confidently use Photoshop for overall layouting and designing, IndDesign for basic layouts, and Illustrator for typograpy and logo making. There are also software that I rarely use, like Ink Scape for logo making and figma for planning and layouting. Drawing Software also provide my more creative option when designing, I use software such as krita and ibis paint for fun drawn elements. When it comes to inspiration, youtube and pinterest helps me to find ideas and elements. </p>

                                <h4>PROGRAMMING</h4>
                                <p> When it comes to coding, I use Visual Studio code and sometime online GDB on for school activities and drills, I use online GDB because our activity in school usually consist of short lines of codes. For Mobile app development I use Android Studio for coding and Figma for planning. I use java language when making my Mobile Application. I also proficient in using Wordpress, AdobeSpark, and google sites in making website.  </p>
